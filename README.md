# HHVcub
The virus causing Chicken pox, shingle, genital herpes, or virus-associated lymphoproliferative disease belongs to the same HHV family, however their targeted cells are different ranging from mucoepithelial to lymphocytes, the same case as their latency sites differ in types of cells of immune system, even particular age groups are infected by particular virus species.

There are rare researches revealing the reasons for variation in clinical symptoms caused by HHVs. In this project, I would like to investigate such reasons from three perspectives:
Variation among HHV family viral sequences; Human genome sequence relevant to targeted cells; clinical electronic data from patients infected by this virus family.
