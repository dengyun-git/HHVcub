# HHVcub
The virus causing Chicken pox, shingle, genital herpes, virus-associated lymphoproliferative diseases belong to the same HHV family, however the targeted cells are different ranging from mucoepithelial to lymphocytes, the same case as latent cells differing in different types of cells of immune system, even different age groups are infected.

There are rare researches revealing the causes for veriation in clinical symptoms. In this project, I would like to investigate such resons from two perspectives:
Variation among HHV family viral sequences; Human genome sequence relevant to targeted cells.
